10 MILLION MINES PROJECT DESIGN AND NOTES

- Find out how many 'cells' I can render in the dom
    - 10 million chars
    - 10 million pixels
    - probably not individual elements
        (have to have events, though)
        what do you assign listeners to?

- A 'cell' can be empty, have a mine, or some other item(s)?

- On click -> send a coordinate that is associated directly
              with a DB -> table -> row -> cell

            -> query UPDATE

            TRIGGERS SSE of updated cell location in DOM
            
            -> 
            NOTE: If there were 1000 spans each with 
                  100 whitespace chars = 100,000

                  10,000 spans @ 100 wide == 1m

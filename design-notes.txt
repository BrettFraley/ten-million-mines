10 MILLION MINES PROJECT DESIGN AND NOTES

- Find out how many 'cells' I can render in the dom
    - 10 million chars
    - 10 million pixels
    - probably not individual elements
        (have to have events, though)
        what do you assign listeners to?

- A 'cell' can be empty, have a mine, or some other item(s)?

- On click -> send a coordinate that is associated directly
              with a DB -> table -> row -> cell

            -> query UPDATE

            TRIGGERS SSE of updated cell location in DOM
            
            -> 
            NOTE: If there were 1000 spans each with 
                  100 whitespace chars = 100,000

                  10,000 spans @ 100 wide == 1m

- HTML/CSS/JS
- API / And SSE event endpoint in Crystal

--------------------------------
DOM
  - So far using 100 spans with 100 pre elements,
    but would like to use just 100 char strings,
    which limits dom access and traversal and styling..etc.
    But I don't want to render or use 10 Million elements

    SOOOOO... go to try to use Highlighted text as choosing
    a cell.. this could get very interesting..

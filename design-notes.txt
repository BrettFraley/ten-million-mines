10 MILLION MINES PROJECT DESIGN AND NOTES

- Find out how many 'cells' I can render in the dom
    - 10 million chars
    - 10 million pixels
    - probably not individual elements
        (have to have events, though)
        what do you assign listeners to?

- A 'cell' can be empty, have a mine, or some other item(s)?

- On click -> send a coordinate that is associated directly
              with a DB -> table -> row -> cell

            -> query UPDATE

            TRIGGERS SSE of updated cell location in DOM
            
            -> 
            NOTE: If there were 1000 spans each with 
                  100 whitespace chars = 100,000

                  10,000 spans @ 100 wide == 1m

- HTML/CSS/JS
- API / And SSE event endpoint in Crystal

--------------------------------
DOM
  - So far using 100 spans with 100 pre elements,
    but would like to use just 100 char strings,
    which limits dom access and traversal and styling..etc.
    But I don't want to render or use 10 Million elements

    SOOOOO... go to try to use Highlighted text as choosing
    a cell.. this could get very interesting..

Okay... 10,000 pre elements is fine.. browser wants to crash
        at unresponsive script at 10x at 100k pre elements


------
getSelection...etc NOTES
-----------------
// getSelection
// getSelection.baseNode.parentElement => 
        // will reference the row span,
        // which coontains the row ID

        // 25th row
        // selction.achorOffset is the start 
        // selection.focusOffset is end

// What if only cells within a row may be highlighted and cleared
// And as a group rows get cleared and eliminated
// Or something like only 2 or 3 may be cleared at a time
// Maybe there's a delay before you may clear your next
// cell or set of cells

There may be a need to then inject a <pre> element
at the index of the highlighted text.. attach functionality/event
listeners, and then apply changes in reverse back to the original
string and remove the injected <pre>

Do I create a <pre> row id with index, assign pre id and 
class in order to alter via CSS.

Front End Flow
---------------
The back end should provide a singular static game of
the mine layout. Pressing begin should load that data
calling init on the game and loading the game.

Highlighting a char, while there will be options of actions to take 
when highlighting a char, for now a cell will simply be revealed..
    - Is it a mine or not
    - If mine, lose.. I don't know what that entails yet
    - Reveal state, alter char, update data
